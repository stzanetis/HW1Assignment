# HW1 Assignment

Tzanetis Savvas - 10889

## Introduction

This repository is part of the **Digital Systems Hardware in Low Level Logic 1** class assignement of the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki**. For this project, we are tasked with implementing a simple calculator, as well as a **RISC-V** processor using **Verilog** and with the help of 5 simple excersices. In the report, which is written in Greek, there is a small description and explanation of the code written, in addition to several waveforms from simulations.

## Tools Used

The `Questa` simulation program was used for all simulations and waveforms provided in the assignment report. Other than that the code was written in the `Visual Studio Code` enviroment.
